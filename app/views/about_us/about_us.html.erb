<h2 class="about_us_title">TorontoEvents </h2>

<p>Toronto Events is a platform for the Toronto community to visit and find out about different events that are happening in Toronto. In addition, people are able to submit events to the website where the Admin will review these events and allow them to be seen by the general public. It is the perfect place to plan an evening out with friends or to show support for your favorite organization and enjoy a well catered meal on the side.</p>
<p> There are 3 different types of users that come to our website. The first type is just the casual visitor who wants to browse and see whatâ€™s going on in Toronto. The second type of user is a user that wants to actually post different upcoming events for the general public to see. These users can also bookmark events and mark the different events that they will be attending. The third type of user is the admin. The admin sends out emails to the users who post events requiring them to make changes to the events that they posted to conform with content standards. The admin also approves those events that qualify to go up on the site and deletes those that do not.
